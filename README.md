Learn about game programming
Hey programmers over there! I am a newbie here. I want to learn how to code to make games (PS4 platform).
I don't know where to start from and how to set up my feets in the gaming industry. I just know that i am having this insane passion for making video games and doing game programming. Though i have never created a game because i was never given an oppurtunity to learn and write a code but i have heard GitHub and so i wanna give it a try.
Please message if anybody wants to help me because i really dont know where to start from in this industry.
